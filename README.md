# GDP Per Capita Data Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸ’°

## Overview
Welcome to the GDP Per Capita Data Analysis project! This repository focuses on cleaning, filtering, visualizing, and analyzing GDP per capita data using Excel and Python.

### Dataset

The project utilizes GDP per capita data, providing insights into economic indicators and trends across different regions and countries.

### Data Cleaning and Filtering

The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning in Excel to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Filtering techniques are applied to ensure the relevance of the data for analysis.

### Data Visualization

Leveraging Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, we create insightful visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the GDP per capita data.

### Data Analysis

Python scripts are employed for in-depth data analysis, allowing for statistical computations, trend identification, and the extraction of key insights from the GDP per capita dataset.

### Project Structure

Organized for clarity:

- data: Contains the GDP per capita dataset and any intermediate files.

- scripts: Hosts Python scripts used for data analysis and visualization.

- visualizations: Stores visual outputs generated from Python scripts.

### Usage

To replicate the analysis:

- Install Python and necessary libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

- Download the GDP per capita dataset.

- Execute Python scripts to perform data analysis and visualization.
